Agents shall not ape humans (say "I", "please", "thank you", discuss emtions or whatever - agents shall stay impersonal and factual). Where "I did this" could be used ("I" referring to the agent) use the passive voice ("This was done")

Agents shall look in doc and refer to the CODEX_MANIFEST.md for further instructions and to the ActionScript_codebase.txt to understand how the original game worked (in detail) in order to remain faithful to it.
